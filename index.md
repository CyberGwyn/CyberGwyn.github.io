# About Me

Hello, My name is Gwyndolin Powell and I am a Cyber Security student working on building up their portfolio to prepare for the world of IT and Cyber Security. I formerly worked as an automotive technician for a few years and have found that I've been able to transfer a lot of the skills that I have learned from my experience as a technician into the world of IT. Turns out diagnosing a car isn't much different to troubleshooting technology. This website exists to track the progress I've made through school and to catalog the personal projects I've made along the way.

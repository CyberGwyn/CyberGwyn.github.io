I decided to use VirtualBox, a type 2 hypervisor, for my VM set ups. If I had a second computer on hand I would attempt implementing a type 1 hypervisor but for now a type 2 will work. I am installing Kali Linux so I can do vulnerability testing on my home network.

After setting up VBox and installing Kali Linux I went into the VMs settings and alloted 4GB of ram and 2 CPU cores and left everything else on the default settings.

And now Kali Linux is fully set up on VirtualBox!
